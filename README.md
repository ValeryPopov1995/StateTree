# StateTree
A behavior tree where nodes are the state of the state machine. It is implemented on an abstract level and has a specific implementation example.

## Sample realization - Npc soldiers
Npc soldiers, divided into two teams, patrol their area and, if suspicious, check their safety and attack, use shelters.

Soldiers talk to each other and can send signals, request help and follow orders from the commander (in progress).

Randomization of the soldier's reaction to events in the behavior tree allows you to make the bot's actions more lively and chaotic.
